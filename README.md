# Configurable FullBright
A vanilla fullbright shader that you can change the strength of.
Allowing for a much nicer viewing experience that does not just look like gamma 9000  
This was mostly created for youtubers, since neither default gamma nor fullbright look good in youtube videos.  

Special Thanks to:  
- **[ShockMicro](https://github.com/ShockMicro)** for creating the [light utility](https://github.com/ShockMicro/Minecraft-Shaders/releases/tag/v1.0-light) that would have taken me a while to do myself
